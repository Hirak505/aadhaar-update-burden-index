# aadhaar-update-burden-index

Data-driven analysis of UIDAI Aadhaar enrolment and update data to compute the Aadhaar Update Burden &amp; Inclusion Index (AUBII) and generate actionable governance insights.

# – Admin Dashboard

This repository contains the Streamlit-based visualization layer for
** AI-Driven Operational Integrity & Anomaly Detection
for the Aadhaar Ecosystem**.

The dashboard enables administrators to visually identify:

- Normal districts
- Hot Spot districts (abnormally high activity)
- Dark Spot districts (abnormally low activity)
- Risk severity levels
- Z-score anomaly intensity
- State-wise anomaly density
- Top red-flagged districts

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The Streamlit dashboard provides:

- State filter and anomaly filters
- Risk severity breakdown (High / Medium / Normal)
- Normal vs red-flagged district overview
- Hot spot vs dark spot distribution
- Z-score deviation scatter plot
- State-wise anomaly density heatmap
- Top red-flagged district table
- Full anomaly report viewer

---

## 📁 Input Data

The dashboard consumes a processed CSV file generated by the
anomaly detection engine:

data/processed/statewise_anomaly_alerts.csv

Expected columns:

- state
- district
- time_period
- enrolment_count
- update_count
- total_activity
- z_score
- anomaly_type
- risk_severity
- final_flag
- recommendation

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the dashboard:

streamlit run app.py

⚠️ Notes

    This repository contains only the visualization layer.

    Anomaly detection logic is implemented separately.

    Raw UIDAI data is not included in this repo.

    The dashboard expects the processed anomaly CSV to exist.
